# This is a sample script that can be used as a template
# for creating your own sub-commands for the "ceylon"
# command. If you create a copy, and rename it to for
# example "ceylon-mycommand" and place it anywhere
# in your $PATH, in ~/.ceylon/bin or in $CEYLON_HOME/bin
# it will be found and automatically be added to the
# list of existing commands (try typing "ceylon help").

USAGE='<arg1> <arg2>'
DESCRIPTION='Example command that does nothing'
LONG_USAGE='This script just shows how to create custom "ceylon" sub-commands.

This long usage information is printed when users run `ceylon help example` or `ceylon example --help`. The plugin system already wraps long lines, so you should avoid wrapping them yourself.'
