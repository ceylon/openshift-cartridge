    &quot;The name of the runtime / virtual machine this process 
     is running on.&quot;
    shared native String name;
    
    &quot;The version of the runtime / virtual machine this

    &quot;The number of bits used to represent the value of an 
     [[Integer]].&quot;
    see (`class Integer`)
    shared native Integer integerSize;
    
    &quot;The number of bits of [[Integer]] instances which may 
     be manipulated via the methods inherited from
     [[Binary]].&quot;
    shared native Integer integerAddressableSize;
    
    &quot;The minimum [[Integer]] value that can be represented 
     by the runtime.
     
     It is the minimum `Integer` that can be distinguished 
     from its successor using below formula:
     
     `Integer(n-1) = Integer(n) - 1` with `Integer(0) = 0`&quot;
    see (`class Integer`)
    shared native Integer minIntegerValue;

    &quot;The maximum [[Integer]] value that can be represented 
     by the runtime.
     
     It is the maximum `Integer` that can be distinguished 
     from its predecessor using below formula:
     
     `Integer(n+1) = Integer(n) + 1` with `Integer(0) = 0`&quot;
    see (`class Integer`)
    shared native Integer maxIntegerValue;
    
    &quot;The maximum size of an [[Array]] that is possible for 
     this runtime. Note that this is a theoretical limit 
     only. In practice it is usually impossible to allocate 
     an array of this size, due to memory constraints.&quot;
