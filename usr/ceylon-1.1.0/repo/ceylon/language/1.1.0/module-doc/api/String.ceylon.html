Each character in the string is a 
   [[32-bit Unicode character|Character]]. The internal 
   UTF-16 encoding is hidden from clients.
   
   Literal strings may be written between double quotes:
   
       &quot;hello world&quot;
       &quot;\r\n&quot;
       &quot;\{#03C0} \{#2248} 3.14159&quot;
       &quot;\{GREEK SMALL LETTER PI} \{ALMOST EQUAL TO} 3.14159&quot;
   
   Alternatively, a _verbatim string_ may be written between
   tripled double quotes.
   
   The _empty string_, `&quot;&quot;`, is a string with no characters.
   
   A string is a [[Category]] of its [[characters]], and of 
   its substrings:
   
       &apos;w&apos; in greeting 
       &quot;hello&quot; in greeting
   
   Strings are [[summable|Summable]]:
   
       String greeting = &quot;hello&quot; + &quot; &quot; + &quot;world&quot;;
   
   They are efficiently [[iterable|Iterable]]:
   
       for (char in &quot;hello world&quot;) { ... }
   
   They are [[lists|List]] of [[characters|Character]]:
   
       value char = &quot;hello world&quot;[5];
   
   They are [[ranged|Ranged]]:
   
       String who = &quot;hello world&quot;[6...];
   
   Note that since `string[index]` evaluates to the optional 
   type `Character?`, it is often more convenient to write 
   `string[index..index]`, which evaluates to a `String` 
   containing a single character, or to the empty string 
   `&quot;&quot;` if `index` refers to a position outside the string.
   
   It is easy to use comprehensions to transform strings:
   
       String { for (s in &quot;hello world&quot;) if (s.letter) s.uppercased }
   
   Since a `String` has an underlying UTF-16 encoding, 
   certain operations are expensive, requiring iteration of 
   the characters of the string. In particular, [[size]]
   requires iteration of the whole string, and `get()`,
   `span()`, and `measure()` require iteration from the 
   beginning of the string to the given index.&quot;&quot;&quot;
