# Ceylon distribution

Here you can find out how to build a Ceylon distribution from code.

## Distribution layout

- `bin`            - Unix/Windows commands
- `contrib`        - Sample Ceylon command-line plugins
- `doc`            - Documentation about Ceylon including the spec in HTML and PDF format
- `lib`            - Required libraries for the Ceylon commands
- `repo`           - Required bootstrap Ceylon modules (language, tools)
- `samples`        - Sample Ceylon modules
- `templates`      - Templates for new Ceylon projects
- `LICENSE-ASL`    - The Ceylon ASL license
- `LICENSE-GPL-CP` - The Ceylon GPL/CP license
- `README.md`      - This file

## Building the distribution

To begin, make sure you have:

- the [Java 7 JDK][] or [Java 8 JDK][] and [Ant 1.8+][] installed and that both are working
correctly (if you installed Ant using your platform's package manager make
sure it installed the `ant-junit.jar` as well, which can be found in a package
named `ant-junit` or `ant-optional` depending on your distribution)
- [Git set up][] correctly
- created a new directory for the Ceylon project
- opened a terminal and changed to the newly created directory

[Java 7 JDK]: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html
[Java 8 JDK]: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html
[Ant 1.8+]: http://ant.apache.org/
[Git set up]: https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git

And now you either set things up for HTTPS access (recommended for most people):

- Clone ceylon:

<!-- lang: bash -->
    $ git clone https://github.com/ceylon/ceylon.git
        
(If you encounter an issue like "fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/ceylon/ceylon.git/': 
Failed connect to github.com:443; No error", make sure you've set up your proxy as git config, ie: 
<!-- lang: bash -->
        $ git config --global http.proxy http://userName:password@proxyServer:port 

that should fix it.)
        
- Go into the newly created `ceylon` directory and build the complete distribution by running:

<!-- lang: bash -->
    $ ant clean dist

After this you'll have a newly built distribution in the `dist` 
folder of your current directory. You can run the `ceylon` command 
without any further setup or installation by simply running

<!-- lang: bash -->
    $ dist/bin/ceylon

But it's advisable to add the `ceylon` command to your `PATH` 
environment variable (either by adding the `bin` folder to your 
`PATH` or by creating a symbolic link to it in an appropriate place 
like `~/bin/`).

If at any time you want to update the distribution to the latest 
code from GitHub just run

<!-- lang: bash -->
    $ git pull --rebase
    $ ant clean dist

NB: The `git pull --rebase` command assumes that your projects are "clean", 
that is you don't have uncommitted changes. If that's not the case 
you'll have to manually update those projects or first stash your 
changes (using `git stash`).

After the build finishes the command line tools will be located in 
the `bin` directory.

- `bin/ceylon`     - The ceylon tool which provides at least the following subcommands:
    * `browse`     - Open module documentation in the browser
    * `classpath`  - Print a classpath suitable for passing to Java tools to run a given Ceylon module
    * `compile`    - Compile a Ceylon program for the Java backend
    * `compile-js` - Compile a Ceylon program for the JavaScript backend
    * `config`     - Manage Ceylon configuration files
    * `copy`       - Copy modules from one module repository to another
    * `doc`        - Document a Ceylon program
    * `help`       - Display help about another tool
    * `info`       - Print information about modules in repositories
    * `import-jar` - Import a Java `.jar` file into a Ceylon module repository
    * `new`        - Generate a new Ceylon project
    * `plugin`     - Package or install command-line plugins
    * `run`        - Run a Ceylon program on the Java VM
    * `run-js`     - Run a Ceylon program on node.js (JavaScript)
    * `src`        - Fetch source archives from a repository and extract them
    * `test`       - Test a Ceylon program on the Java VM
    * `test-js`    - Test a Ceylon program on node.js (JavaScript)
    * `version`    - Show and update version numbers in module descriptors
    * `war`        - Generate a WAR file from a compiled `.car` file

The API documentation for the language module `ceylon.language` may 
be found here:

- `repo/ceylon/language/1.2.1/module-doc/api`

## Running the sample programs

To compile and run the samples, read the README.md contained in
the `samples` sub folder for instructions.

## Tool usage

To see a list of command line options for a particular subcommand,
use the `help` subcommand. For example, to get help on the `compile` 
tool:

    ceylon help compile

## Setting up Eclipse

See [README.eclipse](../README.eclipse) for the instructions in setting up your Eclipse
environment for Ceylon development.

## Ant tasks for Ceylon

We include support for Ceylon ant tasks which are documented at 
<http://ceylon-lang.org/documentation/1.2.1/reference/tool/ant/>.

To run the "hello world" program using ant, type:

    cd samples/helloworld
    ant
