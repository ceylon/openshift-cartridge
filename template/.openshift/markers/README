Markers
===========

Adding marker files to this directory will have the following effects:

enable_aether - Will add the aether repo to your compilation and run (there is more to it than just adding 
    `--rep aether`, because we need to tell Maven where to cache stuff so we have to create folders and a
    `settings.xml` and point to it, so just use this rather than deal with it yourself)

enable_jpda - Will run your application with JPDA enabled on port 8787

force_clean_build - Will remove all previous php pears and start installing
    required pears from scratch

hot_deploy - Will prevent the apache process from being restarted during
    build/deployment

disable_auto_scaling - Will prevent scalable applications from scaling up 
                       or down according to application load.
